DATASET INFORMATION


==================================================


DATASET OVERVIEW


This folder contains the dataset used for the mini project titled:

"Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Automated Bone Fracture Detection"


Due to the large size of the dataset (8,683 images), it is not uploaded directly to GitHub.

The complete dataset can be accessed from the Google Drive link below:

The dataset consists of X-ray images of human bones categorized into two classes:

1. Fractured

2. Non-Fractured



These images were used to train, validate, and test the deep learning models.

PREPROCESSING APPLIED


The following preprocessing steps were applied before model training:


1. Image resizing to 224 x 224 pixels

2. Pixel normalization

3. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance contrast and improve fracture visibility
