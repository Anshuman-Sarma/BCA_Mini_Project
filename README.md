PROJECT OVERVIEW

This mini project was developed as part of the 5th semester
BCA curriculum. The objective of the project is to analyze and
compare the performance of different deep learning models for
automatic bone fracture detection using X-ray images.

Deep learning techniques were applied to classify X-ray images
into fractured and non-fractured categories, and the performance
of each model was evaluated using standard metrics.

--------------------------------------------------

MODELS USED

The following deep learning models were implemented and evaluated:

1. ResNet50
2. DenseNet121
3. VGG16
4. MobileNet

All models were trained and tested using the same dataset and
preprocessing techniques to ensure fair comparison.

DATASET INFORMATION

The dataset consists of X-ray images of human bones categorized
into fractured and non-fractured classes.

Due to the large size of the dataset (8000+ images), the raw data
is not uploaded to GitHub. A Google Drive link to the dataset is
provided inside the Dataset folder.
