SOURCE CODE INFORMATION

This folder contains the source code developed for the BCA 5th Semester
mini project titled:

"Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Bone Fracture Detection"

The implementations are provided in the form of Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
files and were used to train and evaluate different deep learning models
on X-ray image data.

--------------------------------------------------

MODELS IMPLEMENTED

The following deep learning models are implemented and evaluated
in this project:

1. ResNet50
2. DenseNet121
3. VGG16
4. MobileNet

Each model was trained and tested using the same dataset and
preprocessing steps to ensure fair comparison.

--------------------------------------------------

SOURCE CODE DETAILS

Each notebook includes:
1. Dataset loading and preprocessing
2. Image resizing and normalization
3. Model architecture definition using pre-trained networks
4. Training and validation process
5. Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

The implementation is carried out using Python and deep learning
libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

IMPORTANT NOTE

The deep learning models used in this project have been properly
referenced in the References section of the project report.

Due to system and storage limitations, trained model weight files
are not included. The models can be regenerated by executing
the provided notebooks.

Before running the programs, ensure that the dataset is downloaded
using the link provided in the Dataset folder and placed in the
appropriate directory structure.
